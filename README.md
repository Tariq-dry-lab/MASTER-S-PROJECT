A) Objectives

Structural Analysis (Objective 1)

Identify conformational differences among four lowest-energy conformers of the model compound.

Quantify differences in bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles.

Establish thresholds for significant structural variation.

Interaction Analysis (Objective 2)

Extract all classes of weak donor–acceptor interactions using NBO (Natural Bond Orbital) analysis.

Apply filters (≥ 3 bonds separation) to retain long-range interactions.

Correlate changes in structural features with interaction strengths.

Compare the role of n→π* with other classes (n→σ*, σ→σ*, π→π*).

B) Methods

Model System: A derivative of propanaldehyde, previously studied at IISER Pune.

C) Tools Used:

Custom scripts for internal coordinate (bond, angle, dihedral) calculations.

NBO analysis outputs to extract donor–acceptor delocalization energies (2nd-order perturbation theory).

Filtering Criteria:

Only donor–acceptor orbital pairs separated by ≥ 3 bonds considered.

Interaction strengths > 0.1 kcal/mol included.
